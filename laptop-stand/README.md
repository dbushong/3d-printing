# Vertical Laptop Holder

## `laptop-stand.scad`

This is based on a design that I **think** I found on Thingiverse, but now
I can't find the source.  Whoever originally made it, thanks for the simple
and elegant design!

I reverse engineered it from scratch, made it parameterized, and let you
specify **multiple** laptop slots.

## `mountain-laptop-stand.scad`

This is a lightly parameterized (can specify single gap width) from-scratch
pretty model by Dawn Bushong, inspired by
[this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4237708), but with a flared base
for more stability.
